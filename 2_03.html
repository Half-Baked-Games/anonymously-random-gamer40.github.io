<p>1. The Doppler radar emmits a microwave signal which goes until it hits something, scrambling the energy and sending a fraction of the emmited energy back to the radar. Since the returned energy is only a fraction of the emmited energy, scientists amplify it to get an acurate reading. This gives information on how far away the object the energy reflected off of is.<br><br>2. Polarized sunglasses contain a special type of filter that reflect the Sun's sometimes dangerous glare. Electromagnetic waves from the sun, such as light often reflect off of surfaces like water, creating a glare. This glare is what polarized glasses block from affecting your eyes.<br><br>3. Sunlight is made up of a bunch of colors that combine to be seen as white. When the light travels through humidity or air, it changes color which is why when it travels through diferent raindrops, it creates a rainbow.<br><br>4. Electromagnetic waves do not always need a medium like other waves such as mechnical waves. However, when an electromagnetic wave goes through a medium, it is slower then when traveling through a vacuum. Light is an electromagnetic wave. Light can be made of particles which are made of groups of energy called photons. Photons have no mass, have a forward force, and travel at the speed of light.<br><br>5.
